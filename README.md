# UK-tree-epidemic-simulator

SubGrid:

1) SubGrid dir contains main script: main.py which is run via a bash script run_sgm.sh
  run_sgm.sh needs to be run either on local machine for small simulations or HPC for big ensemble simulations
    (HPC in a task array ~100 cores @ ARC3)
    
2) Output is a function mapping tree density (and other epidemic parameters) to expected wave-speed of pathogen.
3) Output data is further processed, visualsed and saved in a .npy file via running output_data/param_space_plots.py 

pde_model:

1) data generated in SubGrid/output_data/param_space_plots.py is saved into pde_model/diffusion_mapping/input_diff_maps/
2) pde_model uses this data to generate a map of diffusion coefficients over the UK 
3) FKPP equation is simulated via finite-difference tequniques (FTCD) over the UK for large scale epidemiology via:
  running run_pde.sh in the terminal which calls main.py 
4) output is stored in pde_model/output_data/, animations and plots generated by running ./animate.sh in the terminal:
  this calls animate.py which generates figures from the saved frames and uses ffmpeg to generate a .mp4 file from .png
  images.
