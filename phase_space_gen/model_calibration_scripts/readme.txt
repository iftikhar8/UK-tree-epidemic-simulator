L calibrate:

Test if the gaussian kernel gives expected average distance of infections.
From the integer values of L - 0,1,..,N. We get the average distance (units = lattice points)
An integer value of i gives average distance of i units...


T-Beta calibrate:

For a lifetime of infected tree of the order of 1 year, pick a suitable range of beta parameters.
